# Negating propositions involving there exists

Lets now consider the second type of logical proposition that can be constructed from many individual propositions.  In this exercise we will consider:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\exists\a\in\A\quad\a>4)

which reads as "there exists an a in the set A which is greater than 4.

The function called `testExists` that I have written in the cell on the left returns a value of one if this proposition is true for the input numpy array A and a value of zero otherwise.  __To complete the exercise I would like you to complete the function called `negationExists`.__  This function should return a value of 1 if the negation of the above statement is true.
